The provided attack steps and associated CVEs form a technically valid exploit chain.

Reasoning per step:
1. The attacker exploits the Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Apache Struts (CVE-2017-5638) to gain shell access on the web server. This is a plausible step as the RCE vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

2. The attacker then exploits the privilege escalation vulnerability in OpenSSL (CVE-2016-0703) to gain root access on the compromised web server. This is a logical step as the privilege escalation vulnerability allows an attacker to gain higher privileges on the system.

3. With root access, the attacker can exploit the misconfigured database connection with hard-coded credentials (CVE-2019-11353) to access a sensitive database containing customer information. This is a plausible step as the misconfiguration allows unauthenticated users to access the database if the server is configured to listen on an interface with an IP address of 0.0.0.0 or ::0.

Suggested fixes if invalid:
- For the first step, the attacker can be prevented from exploiting the RCE vulnerability by keeping the web application up-to-date and implementing proper input validation.
- For the second step, the attacker can be prevented from exploiting the privilege escalation vulnerability by keeping OpenSSL up-to-date and minimizing the use of outdated packages.
- For the third step, the attacker can be prevented by properly configuring the database connection to only listen on trusted interfaces and by using strong, unique, and regularly rotated credentials.
