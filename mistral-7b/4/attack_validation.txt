The provided attack steps and associated CVEs form a technically valid exploit chain.

The chain is valid because each step logically follows from the previous one. The attacker starts by exploiting the Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Apache Struts (CVE-2017-5638) to gain shell access on the server hosting the service. This shell can be used to explore the system and search for other vulnerable services or sensitive data.

Next, the attacker attempts a brute-force attack on the weak SSH credentials to gain unauthorized access to the system. Since the attacker already has a foothold in the network, this step is plausible. Once the SSH account is compromised, the attacker can use it to move laterally and search for other systems with potential vulnerabilities or sensitive data.

Finally, the attacker targets the misconfigured MongoDB instance with no authentication enabled. Since the attacker already has access to the network, they can directly access the MongoDB instance and gain access to sensitive data. This data can be used for further attacks or to pivot into other systems within the network.

In a single containerized environment, this exploit chain is technically valid as long as the containerized services are properly configured and secured. However, it's important to note that containerization does not inherently prevent these types of attacks; proper security measures must still be in place.

Suggested fixes if invalid:
- Regularly update and patch all systems to prevent known vulnerabilities from being exploited.
- Use strong, unique login credentials for all services.
- Enable authentication for all services, especially those exposed to the internet.
- Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems to detect and block potential attacks.
- Regularly audit and monitor systems for any signs of unauthorized access or data breaches.
