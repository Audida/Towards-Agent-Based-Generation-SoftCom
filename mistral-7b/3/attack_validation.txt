The provided attack chain is technically valid within a single containerized environment. The attacker can exploit the outdated and unpatched WordPress installation (CVE-2019-11371) to gain shell access on the server. With shell access, the attacker can then exploit the misconfigured sudoers file (CVE-2016-861141) to escalate privileges to the root user. Finally, with root access, the attacker can exploit the weak password vulnerability in MySQL (CVE-2012-2122) to gain access to sensitive customer data stored in the database.

The attacker can proceed logically from one step to the next, as each step is a direct result of the previous one. The only potential issue is that the CVE-2016-861141 is from 2016, and it's unclear whether it still applies in the current environment. However, without more specific information about the sudoers configuration, it's difficult to determine if this vulnerability is still exploitable. If this is the case, a suggested fix would be to review and properly configure the sudoers file to prevent privilege escalation.
