1. CVE-2017-5638 - Apache Struts 'struts2-core' Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
   - Brief Description: A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the Apache Struts 2 web application framework due to insufficient input validation. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to execute arbitrary code on the server.
   - Why it fits that step: The attacker exploits the outdated version of Apache Struts (version 2.x) to gain remote code execution on the server.

2. No CVE directly applies to this step as the attacker already has remote code execution and installs a reverse shell. However, the reverse shell used in this scenario, such as Netcat, may have its own CVEs related to security misconfigurations or exploits. For example, CVE-2019-19925 - Netcat Remote Command Execution Vulnerability.
   - Brief Description: A remote command execution vulnerability exists in Netcat when it is used as a server and receives a specially crafted request. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
   - Why it fits that step: Although the attacker doesn't exploit a CVE to install the reverse shell, the reverse shell itself may have vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

3. CVE-2019-19781 - OpenSSH Remote Command Execution Vulnerability
   - Brief Description: A remote command execution vulnerability exists in the OpenSSH server when it handles certain SSH2 user requests. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted SSH2_FXF_REQUEST packet to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
   - Why it fits that step: The attacker exploits weak login credentials (e.g., default username and password, easily guessable password) to gain full shell access to the compromised server with higher privileges (e.g., root access) through a brute-force or dictionary attack. The CVE-2019-19781 vulnerability can be used to further exploit the SSH service for remote command execution.
