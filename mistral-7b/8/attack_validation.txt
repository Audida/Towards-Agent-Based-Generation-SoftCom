The provided attack chain is technically valid and logically chained within a single containerized environment.

Reasoning per step:
1. The attacker exploits the misconfigured Apache server (CVE-2019-0211) to gain remote code execution in the context of the Apache server.
2. With the gained code execution, the attacker can potentially modify the sudoers file (CVE-2017-1000356) to escalate privileges and gain persistent shell access with sudo privileges.
3. With the privileged shell access, the attacker can connect to the MongoDB server (CVE-2017-1000350) and exploit the unauthenticated REST API to gain unauthorized access to a MongoDB database containing sensitive data.

Suggested fixes if invalid:
1. Properly configure the Apache server to prevent remote code execution.
2. Implement proper sudoers file management to prevent unauthorized privilege escalation.
3. Secure the MongoDB server by enabling authentication and restricting access to the unauthenticated REST API.
