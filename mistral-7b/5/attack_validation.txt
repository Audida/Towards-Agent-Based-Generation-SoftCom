The provided attack steps and associated CVEs form a technically valid exploit chain.

Reasoning per step:
1. The attacker exploits the RCE vulnerability in the outdated Struts version (CVE-2017-5638) to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the Apache user. This allows the attacker to search for sensitive data, including credentials for other services.

2. With the obtained credentials, the attacker can connect to the MySQL server (CVE-2012-2122) without authentication due to the misconfiguration of the bind-address. This grants the attacker unauthenticated access to the MySQL database containing sensitive data such as usernames, passwords, and financial information.

3. Using the obtained sensitive data, the attacker can exploit the RCE vulnerability in the outdated Tomcat version (CVE-2017-7802) to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the Tomcat user. This allows the attacker to move laterally within the network, potentially compromising other services and escalating privileges.

Suggested fixes if invalid:
- Patch the Apache Struts, MySQL, and Tomcat servers with the latest versions to address the vulnerabilities.
- Implement proper input validation and access controls to prevent unauthorized access and code execution.
- Configure the MySQL server to only listen on the local IP address instead of the public IP address.
- Implement a strong access control mechanism for the database, such as strong passwords, encryption, and multi-factor authentication.
- Regularly monitor and audit the network for any signs of unauthorized access or activity.
