1. Entry point: Externally exposed HTTP server running on port 80 with outdated and unpatched version of Apache Struts (CVE-2017-5638).
   - CVE ID: CVE-2017-5638
   - Brief description: Apache Struts 2.3.x through 2.3.31, 2.5.x through 2.5.10, and 2.5.14 through 2.5.16 have a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability due to insufficient input validation in the Struts `struts2-core` library.
   - Why it fits that step: The attacker exploits the RCE vulnerability in the outdated Struts version to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the Apache user.

2. Entry point: Service running on port 3306 with MySQL server version 5.5.x, which is outdated and vulnerable to the MySQL "bind-address" misconfiguration (CVE-2012-2122).
   - CVE ID: CVE-2012-2122
   - Brief description: MySQL before 5.6.6 allows remote attackers to bypass the bind-address restriction by using a TCP/IP socket in combination with a local (127.0.0.1) and remote address.
   - Why it fits that step: The MySQL server is listening on the public IP address, allowing remote attackers to connect and access the database without authentication.

3. Entry point: Service running on port 8080 with an outdated and unpatched version of Tomcat (CVE-2017-7802).
   - CVE ID: CVE-2017-7802
   - Brief description: Apache Tomcat Manager WebApplication allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via the "path" parameter in the "deploy" request.
   - Why it fits that step: The attacker exploits the RCE vulnerability in the outdated Tomcat version to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the Tomcat user.
