The provided attack steps and associated CVEs form a technically valid exploit chain.

The chain is valid because each step logically follows from the previous one. Here's the reasoning per step:

1. The attacker exploits the Drupalgeddon2 RCE vulnerability (CVE-2018-7600) to gain shell access on the web server.

2. With shell access, the attacker can potentially exploit other vulnerabilities on the compromised web server, such as OpenSSL Heartbleed (CVE-2015-3113), to escalate their privileges and gain root access.

3. With root access, the attacker can access the MySQL database without proper authentication if the password is not set or is weak (CVE-2012-2122), allowing them to dump sensitive user data.

There are no suggested fixes for this valid exploit chain, as the focus is on validating the chain rather than mitigating the vulnerabilities. However, it's important to note that proper security measures, such as keeping software up-to-date, setting strong passwords, and implementing least privilege principles, can help prevent such attacks.
