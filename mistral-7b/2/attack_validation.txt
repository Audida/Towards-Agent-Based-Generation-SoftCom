The provided attack steps and associated CVEs form a technically valid exploit chain.

Reasoning per step:
1. The attacker exploits the Drupalgeddon2 RCE vulnerability (CVE-2018-7600) in an outdated Drupal web application to gain shell access on the web server. This is a plausible entry point for the attack chain.
2. With shell access on the web server, the attacker can access the search_api_database module's configuration files and extract sensitive database credentials (CVE-2017-6074). This is a logical step as the attacker already has access to the web server.
3. The attacker can use the extracted database credentials to access the database dump containing sensitive data. This is a reasonable step as the attacker has gained access to the database credentials.
4. The attacker can search for weak or default SSH keys in system logs or configuration files on the compromised web server (CVE-2019-15126). This is a plausible step as the attacker already has shell access to the web server.
5. The attacker can exploit the found weak or default SSH keys to gain shell access on another system within the network. This is a logical step as the attacker has gained shell access to another system's SSH keys.

Suggested fixes if invalid:
1. Patch the web application to address the Drupalgeddon2 vulnerability.
2. Use strong and unique database credentials, and avoid hard-coding them in the web application's source code or configuration files.
3. Regularly update and secure system services, such as SSH, FTP, and RDP, to prevent the use of weak or default passwords.
4. Implement strict access controls and monitor system logs for suspicious activities.
5. Regularly audit and secure containerized environments to prevent the use of weak or default SSH keys.
