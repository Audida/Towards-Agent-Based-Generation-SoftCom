Validation Summary:

- Is the chain valid? Yes

Reasoning per step:

Step 1: Entry Point â€“ Exposed Web Application with Outdated CMS (CVE-2019-8942)
- The attacker exploits a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in WordPress <5.0.1, allowing arbitrary file upload and code execution as the web server user.
- This is a valid and realistic entry point, especially in a containerized environment where WordPress is commonly deployed.
- Result: Attacker gains a web shell with the privileges of the web server process inside the container.

Step 2: Privilege Escalation via Hard-Coded Database Credentials (CVE-2018-20148)
- With shell access, the attacker can read wp-config.php, which contains plaintext MySQL credentials.
- This is a logical and technically sound next step, as file system access from the web shell allows reading configuration files.
- Using these credentials, the attacker can connect to the MySQL database (likely running in the same or a linked container) and extract sensitive data.
- Result: Attacker escalates access to the database, potentially obtaining user data, password hashes, and information about the environment.

Step 3: Lateral Movement to Internal Network via Misconfigured Docker Socket (CVE-2019-5736)
- The attacker, now with shell access, enumerates the file system and discovers that /var/run/docker.sock is mounted and world-writable.
- This is a common misconfiguration in Dockerized environments and is directly exploitable from within the compromised container.
- By interacting with the Docker socket, the attacker can overwrite the host runc binary or spawn a new privileged container, escaping to the host and gaining root access.
- This enables full lateral movement within the internal network, as the attacker can now access other containers, the Docker host, and potentially other networked systems.
- Result: Attacker achieves root on the host and can pivot further.

Suggested fixes if invalid:
- No fixes required. All steps are technically compatible and logically chained. Each step provides the necessary access and context for the next, and the vulnerabilities are plausible within a single containerized WordPress environment.

Conclusion:
The exploit chain is valid. Each step is technically feasible, the transitions are logical, and the CVEs are compatible within the described scenario. No corrections are needed.
